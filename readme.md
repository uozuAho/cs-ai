# cs ai

Yet another ai library, this time using C#.

See other ai projects (todo: links)

# Getting started

- install dotnet core, then

```
    dotnet build
    dotnet test
```

games/ has some runnable console projects. Use `dotnet run`
in their *.console directories.

# todo - non deterministic actions

- create a new ISearchProblem for non-deterministic actions
- solution will be a tree, not a sequence
